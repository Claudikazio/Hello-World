# Hello-World

This is my first project on GitHub

I'm new to this so there's not much I can really tell about myself, but since this is a test run I'm gonna let you know two of my most useless talents:
1. I'm weirdly good at writing in mirror writing.
2. I'm very good at spotting 4 leaf clovers. 
that's it.
